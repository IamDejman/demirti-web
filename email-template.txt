Hi [Name],

Because you've joined us for one of our previous sessions, we know you are serious about your career growth. That's why we wanted to make sure you didn't miss this one.

If you've been thinking about making a career shift into Tech Project Management but aren't sure where to start (or how your current skills apply), this session is designed specifically for you.

Join us tomorrow, Saturday, Dec 6th, for "Breaking into Tech: Pivoting to Project Management."

We are hosting Oge Achomadu (Project Operations/Lead at Check), who will move beyond the buzzwords and break down exactly what it takes to transition into a PM role—no matter your background.

Whether you're coming from a completely different industry or looking to formalize your project coordination experience, you'll walk away with a clear roadmap.
